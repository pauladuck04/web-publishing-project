                <h3>ABOUT FORMULA STUDENT</h3>
                <p>Formula Student is an international engineering competition 
                where university teams design, build, and race a formula-style
                 car. Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays an increasingly 
                 significant role, especially in autonomous vehicle challenges.
                  Teams implement AI algorithms for self-driving capabilities, 
                  using technologies like computer vision, path planning, and 
                  sensor fusion. AI enables the car to recognize track 
                  boundaries, avoid obstacles, and optimize racing strategies. 
                  Machine learning models process data from cameras, LiDAR, 
                  and GPS to make split-second decisions. AI in Formula Student 
                  promotes innovation in autonomous systems, aligning with 
                  industry trends in automated mobility. Students gain hands-on 
                  experience with cutting-edge AI tools, enhancing both 
                  technical and teamwork skills. The competition encourages 
                  sustainability, efficiency, and pushing the boundaries of 
                  automotive engineering. Formula Student AI showcases the 
                  future of autonomous racing, blending engineering excellence 
                  with artificial intelligence.</p>

                <h3>DYNAMIC EVENTS</h3>
                <p>
                    In Formula Student UK AI (FSUK-AI), Dynamic Events test 
                    the performance, reliability, and intelligence of autonomous 
                    vehicles built by student teams. These events evaluate how well 
                    the car's AI systems, such as perception, path planning, and 
                    control, function under realistic racing conditions. The primary 
                    dynamic events include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Autonomous Acceleration: The car must drive in a straight line as 
                        quickly as possible from a standing start, showcasing its ability to 
                        manage speed and control efficiently
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Skid Pad: The vehicle navigates a figure-eight pattern to evaluate 
                        its cornering ability, traction control, and precise navigation
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Track Drive: The car autonomously completes a series of laps on a 
                        predefined track with sharp turns, straights, and obstacles, testing the 
                        AI’s path planning and obstacle avoidance
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Autocross: Similar to Track Drive, this event focuses on completing 
                        a single timed lap to demonstrate the car’s agility and accuracy.
                        Dynamic events challenge teams to create AI systems that combine speed, 
                        precision, and safety, driving innovation in autonomous vehicle technologies
