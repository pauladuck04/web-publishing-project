                <p>
                    On 6 March, the UVigo Motorsport team had the privilege of visiting 
                    the facilities of the Galician Supercomputing Centre (CESGA), as 
                    part of its collaboration with the team. CESGA is recognised as the 
                    most important supercomputing centre in Galicia, standing out in the 
                    field of high-performance computing and quantum technologies. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the day of our visit, we were cordially received by the Director 
                    of CESGA, Lois Orosa Nogueira, with whom the Team Leader of UVigo 
                    Motorsport, Denis Pallarés Roque, formalised the collaboration agreement, 
                    as we had done in previous seasons. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, we had the kindness of Fernando Bouzas Sierra, who guided 
                    us through all the CESGA facilities, which were extremely interesting. 
                    One of the highlights was a very peculiar quantum computer, of which 
                    few of us have had the opportunity to see it, as it was undergoing 
                    maintenance work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During our visit, Pablo Dorrío Vázquez and Sergio Enrique Aramburu García 
                    representing autonomous, together with the head of Organisation and 
                    Marketing Óscar Rodríguez Fernández had the opportunity to explore CESGA's 
                    facilities in detail and to admire its supercomputer, the Finisterrae III, 
                    installed in 2022. With this supercomputer we have boosted the training of 
                    complex neural networks, using its parallel calculation capacity to process 
                    large data sets and thus adjust many parameters. This allows us, using 
                    deep-learning techniques, to accurately model a perception of the environment 
                    independent of the environmental context, which is an advantage when attending 
                    Formula Student competitions.
