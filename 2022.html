            <h2>OBJECTIVES</h2>
            <p>The main objective was to begin investigating the content 
                of static tests, understanding the dynamics of the competition, 
                and starting the development of a prototype for the structure of 
                the autonomous system. During this year, we focused on gaining a 
                deep understanding of the types of static tests that would be 
                necessary to assess the performance and reliability of the system. 
                This included exploring the technical requirements and conditions 
                under which the system would be evaluated.
                <br>
                In parallel, we worked on analyzing how the competition would 
                function, ensuring that our system was designed to meet the 
                specific challenges and standards required. This involved studying 
                the rules, constraints, and expectations of the competition to 
                align our objectives accordingly.
                <br>
                Additionally, we started developing a prototype that would lay 
                the groundwork for the overall structure of the autonomous system. 
                This early prototype aimed to define the key components and how 
                they would integrate, providing a clear vision for the final system's 
                architecture. This work was essential in shaping the future direction 
                of the project and ensuring that the team was prepared for the next 
                stages of development.</p>

            <h2>ACHIEVEMENTS</h2>
            <p>Our team achieved significant milestones that have laid a strong 
                foundation for the future of our autonomous vehicle project. One of the 
                key achievements was the establishment of the final structure for the 
                first prototype of our autonomous car. This involved designing and integrating 
                the core components that would define the overall architecture, ensuring a 
                cohesive and functional system. The prototype served as a crucial step in 
                visualizing the complete system and refining the design to meet the performance 
                requirements for autonomous operation.
                <br>
                Another important achievement was the completion of a comprehensive study on the 
                FSUK-AI competition. This research was vital for understanding the competition's 
                technical challenges, rules, and performance expectations. By thoroughly analyzing 
                the competition framework, we were able to tailor our development process to align 
                with the specific demands of future events. This preparation not only ensured we 
                were ready for the upcoming challenges but also helped us identify areas for 
                improvement and optimization in our system, setting the stage for future success in 
                the competitive arena.</p>
