            <h2>OBJECTIVES</h2>
            <p>The year 2021 was a crucial starting point for our team, 
                setting the primary goal of laying the groundwork for the 
                development of an innovative and efficient autonomous system. 
                During this year, we focused on exploring the key areas 
                required to build this technology, starting with an in-depth 
                investigation into the sensors that would be essential for 
                accurately collecting environmental data. This involved 
                evaluating multiple technological options, analyzing their 
                capabilities, limitations, and compatibility with our specific 
                needs. Our objective was to identify solutions that ensured the 
                precision and reliability necessary for the system.
                <br>
                At the same time, we dedicated significant effort to analyzing 
                potential algorithms for implementation. This work included 
                researching advanced data processing methods and decision-making 
                models to ensure the system could interpret the collected data 
                and act autonomously. This approach not only established a solid 
                technical foundation but also set a clear direction for future 
                developments. Thus, 2021 was a year devoted to building the pillars 
                of a technology that addresses future challenges and marks the 
                beginning of our commitment to innovation and excellence.</p>

            <h2>ACHIEVEMENTS</h2>
            The year 2021 marked a turning point in the development of our 
                autonomous system, solidifying key decisions in fundamental 
                technical areas critical for its implementation. Regarding 
                sensing technologies, an extensive analysis of the available 
                options in the market was conducted, which led to the selection 
                of the ZED 2 camera as the most suitable solution. This camera 
                was chosen due to its ability to deliver high-precision stereo 
                vision, a crucial feature for capturing three-dimensional 
                environmental information. With this technology, the system 
                can better recognize distances and object dimensions in its 
                surroundings, facilitating processes such as mapping and 
                autonomous navigation.
                <br>
                For positioning, the decision to implement an RTK 
                (Real-Time Kinematic) system represented a significant step 
                toward achieving precision and reliability in the project. 
                This system allowed us to achieve centimeter-level accuracy in 
                location data, which is critical for tasks requiring exact 
                positioning, such as trajectory tracking, motion control, and 
                synchronization with other system components. The integration 
                of these technologies not only laid the foundation for a more 
                robust and efficient system but also marked significant progress 
                toward our goal of creating an innovative and reliable autonomous 
                solution.
