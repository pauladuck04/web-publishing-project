                    The UVigo Motorsport Driverless team took part last week 
                    in Formula Student UK. This competition brings together 
                    arious university teams from around the world who strive 
                    to achieve the best results. This year, after being their 
                    second season attending Formula Student UK AI, UVigo 
                    Motorsport's Driverless made their mark by achieving a 
                    seventh place and a total of 364.8 points in the Overall.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This 2023/2024 season, the level of competition increased 
                    significantly compared to last year so fighting for every 
                    position became more important than ever. It is worth mentioning 
                    the Formula Student Simracing championship in which we came fifth 
                    out of 32 participants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This year was the first time in the history of Driverless that they 
                    were able to pass one of the Dynamic tests: the Track Drive, which 
                    consists of driving ten laps on a random circuit. We received a 
                    total of 100 points for completing all ten laps. The other dynamic 
                    tests: the Sprint, Skidpad and Acceleration were not passed due to 
                    various problems with the standalone software. The completion of 
                    this test was a source of pride for the whole team as it is very 
                    difficult to complete the dynamic tests due to the complexity of 
                    the autonomous system, something that very few teams achieve.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the other hand, in the Static tests we highlight the Business 
                    Plan Presentation, reaching a total of 74 points and doubling the 
                    score with respect to the previous year, reaching a meritorious P9. 
                    In addition, in Simulation we received a total of 48.8 points. On 
                    the other hand, in ADR and Real World AI we improved our score with 
                    respect to last year with 92 and 50 points respectively in these 
                    tests.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of our main objectives was to complete some of the dynamic tests 
                    in the competition and we more than achieved this thanks to TrackDrive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It has been a competition full of many different emotions and a lot of 
                    hard work. The level of knowledge and work was noticeable in the 
                    different teams that participated, being able to learn a lot from them, 
                    being a season of which we can not feel more proud for all the success 
                    achieved. From this competition we take with us the work of each one of 
                    us accompanied by all the obstacles overcome and the emotion and pride 
                    of our autonomous system.
