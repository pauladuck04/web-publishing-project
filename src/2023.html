            <h2>OBJECTIVES</h2>
            <p>The main objectives of that year were focused on laying the 
                groundwork for the successful development of our autonomous 
                system. A key priority was to begin developing the code for 
                the autonomous system, marking the first steps in creating a 
                fully functional, intelligent vehicle. This involved coding 
                the foundational algorithms that would allow the system to 
                perceive its environment, make decisions, and control the 
                vehicle autonomously.
                <br>
                In addition to the software development, we dedicated significant 
                efforts to designing the chassis that would support the system, 
                ensuring it complied with the regulations required for competition 
                participation. This chassis needed to be both robust and adaptable, 
                providing the necessary framework to integrate all the system's 
                components while meeting the specific criteria set by the competition 
                organizers.
                <br>
                Furthermore, we developed a small remote control (RC) vehicle to test 
                the code in real-world conditions. This prototype allowed us to simulate 
                the autonomous system's performance in a controlled environment before 
                transitioning to a full-scale model. The RC vehicle served as an essential 
                testing tool, enabling us to debug and refine the code and ensure that the 
                system would function correctly in real-world scenarios. These objectives 
                laid the foundation for future advancements and set the team on a path 
                toward successfully competing in upcoming events.</p>

            <h2>ACHIEVEMENTS</h2>
            <p>This season, our team achieved a significant milestone by 
                participating in our first competition within the AI department. 
                Despite facing several challenges, we were able to secure 13th 
                place in the overall ranking, which was a notable accomplishment 
                given the circumstances. Although we were unable to complete any 
                of the dynamic tests during the competition, the experience proved 
                invaluable in identifying areas for improvement and gaining a 
                deeper understanding of the competition's technical demands.
                <br>
                The fact that we achieved a solid position despite not completing 
                the dynamic challenges highlights the progress we made in terms 
                of system development, team coordination, and problem-solving. It 
                also reinforced the importance of thorough preparation and testing 
                in real-world conditions. This participation marked an important 
                learning opportunity, setting the stage for future improvements and 
                better performance in upcoming competitions. The insights gained 
                from this experience will drive our efforts as we continue to refine 
                our autonomous system and work toward our long-term goals.
