                <p>
                    Throughout last week, the team of the University of Vigo competed 
                    against teams from around the world in a very special edition of 
                    the Formula Student United Kingdom (FSUK), its 25th anniversary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For this special occasion, UVigo Motorsport was presented to the 
                    event with 2 teams, the traditional combustion team, and an 
                    important novelty, for the first time, the Autonomous Department 
                    participated in a competition of autonomous cars, FSUK Artificial 
                    Intelligence (FSUK AI).
                </p>
                <p>
                    After arriving at the circuit last Tuesday 18 July 2023, the 44 
                    team members in attendance started work, to get everything ready 
                    before starting the next day's inspections.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On behalf of the AI team, the autonomous system was able to pass 
                    all the safety inspections and technical tests, thus being able 
                    to participate in all the dynamic tests scheduled for the prototype.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As for the UM23, all the technical and safety inspections were passed 
                    on the first day of competition without any major mishaps. On the 
                    following day, the three technical tests required for the combustion 
                    vehicles were completed, as well as those for the 4 drivers. Up to this 
                    point, UVigo Motorsport was the 8th team to pass these inspections in 
                    record time for us, which allowed the team to spend time fine-tuning 
                    the car for the next day's tests.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the car was ready, and all the tests and inspections had been 
                    passed, the only thing left to do was to run the car. So, over the 
                    course of the weekend, the UM23 was able to run every single dynamic 
                    test, which we had only achieved twice before in the team's history.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On Saturday morning, the Skidpad and Acceleration were successfully 
                    completed, achieving 6th and 11th place respectively, while in the 
                    afternoon, the Sprint test was successfully completed, obtaining 
                    another 6th place. Finishing Saturday with the first 3 dynamic tests 
                    successfully passed, only the most demanding test of the Formula Student, 
                    the Endurance, was left for Sunday.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When it was time to enter the race, the order of entry was reversed to 
                    the ranking of the previous day's sprint times, so it was not until after 
                    midday that the participation window for the UM23 was opened. Unfortunately, 
                    a sensor failure made it impossible to finish the race, and although the 
                    problem was easily solved, there was no option to try again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All these results, added to the 6th place in the Engineering Design Report, 
                    the 4th in Lap Time Simulation, and the points obtained in the rest of the 
                    static tests, gave the team a total score of 344.4 points, which is the 
                    highest score obtained by the team in a competition and which translates 
                    into an incredible 10th position in the overall ranking of the competition, 
                    which includes all the teams, both internal combustion and electric, which 
                    adds up to more than 60 teams, so it is a result of which we are very proud.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a final touch, the team attended the farewell gala and awards ceremony on 
                    Sunday evening, with the intention of supporting and congratulating the other 
                    teams. But they left in a very different way to the way they came in. Everyone 
                    in the team was surprised when, at one point during the ceremony, they heard 
                    "car number 14, UVigo Motorsport" called to the stage to present us with the 
                    Best Newcomer 2023 trophy, which is awarded to the team with the best results 
                    among those competing in FSUK for the first time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are not only proud, but euphoric about the results. They are at the level 
                    of our best expectations, and we can only consider them a resounding success 
                    and the greatest possible reward for our months of effort and dedication.
